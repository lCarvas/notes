"IT governance is the responsibility of executives and the board of directors, and consists of the leadership, organisational structures and processes that ensure that the enterprise’s IT sustains and extends the organisation’s strategy and objectives." - IT Governance Institute, 2005

## Why IT Governance?

"While in the past, business executives could delegate, ignore, or avoid IT decisions, this is now impossible in most sectors and industries" - Peterson, 2003; Duffy, 2002a; Van Der Zee & De Jong, 1999
