# Chapter 8 - IT Governance Components, Frameworks and Standards

## IT Governance Framework

- A Set of Principles
- A Decision Making Hierarchy
- Reporting and Monitoring Processes
- Unique Business Model and a Risk Environment

## The Seven Key Decision Areas for Designing an IT Governance Framework

1. IT governance principles and decision-making hierarchy
   - Governance principles (how IT is to be managed in the organisation)
   - Implementation principles (how IT is to be used to achieve the business strategy)
2. Information strategy
3. IT strategy
4. IT risk management
5. IT architecture
   - How are IT services specified, developed, authorised, acquired and managed
   - What services should be outsourced. How, why and to whom.
6. IT investment and project governance
   - How should projects be prioritised
   - How should they be project-managed
   - What returns should be expected
7. Regulatory compliance and information security
   - What are the criteria for securing information
   - How is legal/regulatory compliance to be demonstrated
   - What audits are required

"An IT governance framework is not a software solution, nor is there a single silver bullet that solves all of an organisation's IT governance challenges."

## ISO/IEC 38500

- "The governance of management processes (and decisions) relating to the information and communications processes used by an organization"
- Provides "guiding principles" for directors of organisations and others to ensure that the use of information technology within their organisation is effective, efficient and acceptable

### Objectives

1. Assure stakeholders confidence in the IT governance if the standard is followed.
2. Inform and guide the directors in their IT governance activities.
3. Provide a basis for objective evaluation of IT governance.

#### Six Principle of IT Governance

- Responsibility
- Strategy
- Acquisition
- Performance
- Conformance
- Human behaviour

### The IT Governance Model in ISO/IEC38500

1. Evaluate the current and future use of IT
2. Direct plans and policies to ensure that IT use meets business requirements
3. Monitor these plans and policies to ensure that IT conforms to policies and performs in accordance with plans

## Implementing IT Governance

1. Where are we?
2. Where do we want to go?
3. How do we get there?

### The IT Governance Implementation Process

**Pre-Requisites**

1. The board must be determined to implement and maintain recognising the benefits and accepting the efforts that will be required
2. Executives and IT governance practitioners commitment to designing and delivering an IT governance framework that will meet the board's requirements

### Convergent Strands

#### Gap Analysis and the Development of a plan

- Self-assessment of IT governance practices in the organisation
- Identification and agreement upon the size of the gap that is to be closed
- Prioritisation (and datelining) of focus areas
- Delegation of responsibilities
- Authorisation of adequate resources
- Monitoring, review and management

#### Business Strategy Requirements of the IT infrastructure and Team

- Clarification of business strategy.
- Identification of key competences and key intellectual assets.
- Creation/confirmation of risk management framework.
- Identification of required applications and IT strategy.
- Comparison to the IT infrastructure actually deployed and services available.
- Prioritisation (and datelining) of areas for change.
- Delegation of responsibilities; (integration with strand 1 responsibilities)
- Authorisation of adequate resources; (integration with strand 1 responsibilities)
- Monitoring, review and management; (integration with strand 1 processes)

#### Strands Assumptions

- The two strands must become one;
- IT team delivers an IT infrastructure that meets the organisation's strategic goals within the context of its risk treatment plan.

### Conclusions

To achieve success when implementing IT governance it is always mandatory to:

- Know where you are, where you want to go and design a plan to achieve it;
- Commitment from all involved (especially from the board);
- Support the processes with good guidance principles, best practices and frameworks;
- Align technology and IT strategy with business requirements;
- Monitor it, Control it, review it, improve it.

## Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)

A process improvement approach rated according maturity levels that can be used to guide process improvement across a project, a division, or an entire organization

### CMMI Interest Areas

- CMMI-DEV
  - Product / Service development
- CMMI-SVC
  - Service establishment, management
- CMMI-ACQ
  - Product and service acquisition

### CMMI Maturity Levels

1. Initial
   - Processes are ad hoc and are applied on a case-by case or individual basis. Reactive
2. Managed
   - Particular work groups define a strategy, monitor and control the work for specific actions. Often reactive
3. Defined
   - Processes are well characterized and understood. Standards, process descriptions, and work procedures are tailored from the organizationâ€™s set of standard processes. Proactive
4. Quantitativel Managed
   - Processes are measured and controlled using statistical and
     other quantitative techniques
5. Optimised
   - Focuses on continually improving process performance
     through incremental and innovative process
