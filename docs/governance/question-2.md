# AI in Healthcare

AI enhances healthcare through precise diagnostics, predictive analytics, personalized treatments, and streamlined workflows. It can analyze medical images, genetic data, or patient records faster and more accurately than humans, improving early disease detection and care efficiency. However, poor training data can lead to misdiagnoses, and if a mistake happens, the consequences are severe.

Incorrect treatments or delayed interventions could have life-threatening outcomes, as such, human supervision is still important.

Mitigating this risk is of utmost priority, for this purpose, Hospitals could share the data between them, in order to have a larger database, comprised of different medical situations, thus lowering the risk of misdiagnoses due to the lack of accurate data on the diseases associated with a set of symptoms.
