# Following-up on the exercise you've done during the class

## What mechanisms work best to regulate? Apply one or two of those mechanisms to one of the following scenarios

- Card 11 - Cryptocurrency Market Manipulation
  - Unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges allow wealthy traders to engage in market manipulation techniques like "pump and dump" schemes, wash trading, and spoofing. Small investors often lose significant funds while manipulative traders profit from artificial price movements.
- Card 12 - Medical AI Diagnostic Liability
  - Hospitals are implementing AI systems to assist with medical diagnoses and treatment recommendations. When these systems make errors leading to patient harm, responsibility is unclear between software developers, healthcare providers, and the institutions implementing the technology.
- Card 13 - Smart Home Privacy Invasion
  - Connected home devices are constantly collecting data about users' private lives, including conversations, behavior patterns, and personal habits. This data is being used for purposes beyond device functionality without transparent disclosure or user control.
- Card 14 - Fast Fashion Environmental Impact
  - Clothing manufacturers are producing increasingly disposable fashion items at low cost, resulting in massive textile waste, water pollution from manufacturing processes, and carbon emissions. The true environmental cost is not reflected in product pricing.

### Card 12

Liability should be risk-based: developers bear responsibility for algorithmic flaws or biased training data, healthcare providers for clinical misuse (e.g., overreliance on AI without oversight), and institutions for inadequate system validation or staff training. Transparency is critical—AI outputs must be explainable to clinicians, and patients should be informed about AI’s role in their care. Regulatory agencies must classify AI as high-risk medical devices, mandating rigorous pre-market validation, continuous post-market monitoring, and real-world performance tracking to detect errors. Hospitals should establish ethics boards to audit AI for bias and equity issues, while global alignment via bodies like WHO ensures consistent safety standards. Finally, updated informed consent protocols and accessible patient redress channels preserve trust.
