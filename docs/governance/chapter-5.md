**Compliance to Regulations**  
The action or fact of complying with a law ([Regulations](#regulations)) or recommended industry standard ([Standards](#standards) or [Best Practices](#best-practices))

## Best Practices

- Methods and techniques that have consistently shown results superior than those achieved with other means, and which are used as benchmarks to strive for. - There is, however, no practice that is best for everyone or in every situation, and no best practice remains best for very long as people keep on finding better ways to of doing things.

## Standards

- Documented agreements
- Contains technical specifications
- Contains rules, guidelines or definitions of characteristics
- Ensure that processes and services fit for their purpose

## Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2022 (SOX)

"An Act to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to the securities laws, and for other purposes."

- Legislation enacted in response to the high-profile financial scandals to protect shareholders and the general public from accounting errors and fraudulent practices in the enterprise.
- Administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which sets deadlines for compliance and publishes rules on requirements.
- Defines which records are to be stored and for how long.

With senior management liability up to $5M and 20 years in jail, this is probably the regulation that has received the most publicity in the last years.

### Motivators

- A number of high-profile incidents across some of the world's biggest accounting firms

### Impact of SOX on IT Audits

The legislation not only affects the financial side of corporations, it also affects the IT departments (operations, processes, security, etc.) whose job it is to store a corporation's electronic records.

All business records, including electronic records and electronic messages, must be saved for "not less than five years.”

## DORA Act

The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), officially Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 is a European Union regulation.

It requires financial entities to improve their digital operational resilience.

DORA aims to improve the digital operational resilience of financial entities in the EU and their ICT suppliers and create a uniform regulatory framework across the EU, in order to reduce the susceptibility to cyber threats across the entire value chain of the financial sector.

## Anti-Bribery Directive

As part of a new anti-corruption package announced on 3 May 2023, the European Commission has proposed a new directive (Directive) which, if implemented, would require EU member states (Member States) to meet common standards in their anti-corruption legislation.

Corruption is estimated to cost the European Union between EUR 179 billion and EUR 990 billion per year, amounting to up to 6% of its GDP

## Common with all regulatory compliance standards

- Protection of Data — relies on both confidentiality and integrity of data.
- Robust Internal Auditing and Controls
- Proactive and Reactive Risk Management
- Documenting Policies and Procedures
- Require the use of external or independent verification
- Continual internal auditing and monitoring to ensure operational controls

## Conclusion

The number and complexity of regulations is growing. In order to reduce costs and still be compliant with a unified strategy you will need to include the auditing controls you already have in place and monitoring them for their effectiveness in order to "know where you are".

Once you "know where you are", you will need to evaluate your requirements based on governing legislation and business strategy.
