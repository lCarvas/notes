# Corporate Greenwashing

The EU already has regulations for Corporate Greenwashing under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (UCPD).
In January 2024, new regulation were added to the UCPD, companies making “green claims” about their products and services have to follow norms on how they "substantiate" and "communicate" them, such claims need to be independently verified and proven with scientific evidence. e.g. Declarations of carbon neutrality must be accompanied by a comprehensive guide outlining all greenhouse gas emissions across the product's whole life cycle. Failure to comply is met with fines.
