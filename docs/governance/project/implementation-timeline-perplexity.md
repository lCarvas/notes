# Timeline

The duration for implementing ISO 31000 in a company can vary significantly depending on the organization's size, complexity, and existing risk management practices. However, a typical implementation process might take anywhere from 6 months to 2 years[1],[4],[9]. Here's a breakdown of the steps and their approximate durations:

## Planning and Preparation (1-3 months)

- Establishing management commitment
- Developing a formal policy
- Identifying and allocating resources
- Understanding internal and external forces[4]

## Framework Development (2-4 months)

- Establishing the risk management scope, context, and criteria
- Designing the risk management framework
- Integrating into organizational processes[1],[2]

## Risk Assessment (3-6 months)

- Risk identification
- Risk analysis
- Risk evaluation[1],[4]

## Risk Treatment (2-4 months)

- Developing risk treatment plans
- Implementing controls[7]

## Implementation and Integration (3-6 months)

- Rolling out the risk management process across the organization
- Training employees
- Integrating risk management into daily operations[9]

## Monitoring and Review (Ongoing)

- Continuous monitoring of the risk management process
- Regular reviews and updates
- Recording and reporting[4],[6]

It's important to note that the implementation of ISO 31000 is not a one-time event but an ongoing process. The monitoring and review phase is continuous and should be integrated into the organization's regular operations[6].

Factors that can affect the duration include:

- The organization's size and complexity
- Existing risk management practices
- Level of management commitment
- Available resources
- Organizational culture and readiness for change[9]

Remember that while the initial implementation may take 6 months to 2 years, maintaining and improving the risk management system is an ongoing process that continues indefinitely[4],[9].
