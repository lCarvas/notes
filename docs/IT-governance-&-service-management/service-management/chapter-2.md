  - Customer: A person who defines requirements for services and takes responsibility for outcomes from service consumption
  - User: A person who uses services
  - Sponsor: A person who authorizes the budget for service consumption
- Suppliers - A stakeholder responsible for providing services that are used by an organization.

## IT as a Service - Output, Outcome, Cost and Risk

Customers seek outcomes but do not wish to manage all the associated specific costs and risks

**Output:** A tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity

**Outcome:** A result for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs

**Cost:** The amount of money spent on a specific activity or resource:

- Costs removed from customer (part of value)
- Costs imposed on customer (costs of consumption)

**Risk:** Possible event that could cause harm or hinder achievement of objectives. (Uncertainty of outcome.)  
Can be seen as:

- Risks removed from the customer (part of value)
- Risks imposed on customer (risks of consumption)
