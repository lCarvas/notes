# The Four Dimensions

To support a holistic approach to service management, ITIL defines four dimensions that collectively are critical to the effective and efficient facilitation of value for customers and other stakeholders in the form of products and services. These are:

- Organizations and people
- Information and technology
- Partners and suppliers
- Value streams and processes

Not addressing all four dimensions can result in services becoming undeliverable, not meeting expectations of quality or efficiency.

For example, failing to consider the value streams and processes dimension holistically can lead to wasteful work, duplication of efforts, or worse, work that conflicts with what is being done elsewhere in the organization.

Equally, ignoring the partners and suppliers dimension could mean that outsourced services are misaligned with the needs of the organization.

The four dimensions do not have sharp boundaries and may overlap. They will sometimes interact in unpredictable ways, depending on the level of complexity and uncertainty in which an organization operates.

The four dimensions apply to all services being managed, as well as to the SVS in general. These perspectives should be considered for every service, and that each one should be addressed when managing and improving the SVS at all levels.

The four dimensions represent a holistic approach to service management, and organizations should ensure that there is a balance of focus between each dimension. The impact of external factors on the four dimensions should also be considered. All four dimensions and the external factors that affect them should be addressed as they evolve, considering emerging trends and opportunities. It is essential that an organization's SVS is considered from all four dimensions, as the failure to adequately address or account for one dimension, or an external factor, can lead to sub-optimal products and services.

## Organizations and People

- Complexity of organizations is growing
- Structure and management should support strategy and operating model
- That includes roles, responsibilities, and systems of authority and communication

- Formal organizational structures, Service teams
- Required staffing & competencies
- Roles and responsibilities
- Culture & Leadership

Organizational effectiveness is not only dependent on a formal structure or system of authority.

It also needs a culture that supports its objectives and employees with the right level of capacity and competency.

Leaders must use values that motivate people to work in desirable ways.

It is how an organization carries out work that creates shared values and attitudes, which are considered the organization's culture.

Aspects that play a role:

- Structure and roles
- Culture and communication styles, a healthy organizational culture
- Collaboration and coordination
- Capable and competent employees
- Leadership and common values
- How activities are carried out

## Information and Technology

- Applies both to service management and to the services being managed
- Information and knowledge necessary to ITSM
- Required technologies
- Relationships between different components of the SVS, such as inputs/outputs of activities and practices.

- Relationships between components
- Technologies
- Information and Technologies knowledge

Consider the following questions:

- What information is managed by the services?
- What information and knowledge are needed to deliver and manage the services?
- How information and knowledge be protected, managed, archived, and disposed of?

Technologies that support service management include:

- workflow management systems,
- knowledge bases,
- inventory systems
- communication systems,
- analytical tools
- Artificial intelligence
- machine learning
- mobile platforms
- cloud solutions
- remote collaboration tools
- automated testing
- deployment solutions

Service management increasingly benefits from developments in technology. Technologies are used at all levels, from strategic planning and portfolio optimization to system monitoring and user support. The use is becoming common practice among service providers.

Another key consideration in this dimension is how information is exchanged between different services and service components. For many services, information management is the primary means of enabling customer value. The challenges of information management, such as those presented by security and regulatory compliance requirements, are also a focus of this dimension. For example, an organization may be subject to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which influences its information management policies and practices.

For an IT service, it includes information created, managed, and used in the course of service provision and consumption.

Information and technologies cover all levels of IT architecture, including applications, databases, communication systems, and their integrations.

IT services use the latest technology developments, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and cognitive computing.

These services provide a business differentiation potential to early adopters, especially in highly competitive industries.

Other technology solutions, such as cloud computing or mobile apps, have become
common practice across many industries globally.

## Partners and Suppliers

- Organizations and services depend partly on external services
- Relationships between organizations involved in design, development, deployment, delivery, support and/or continual improvement of services
- This dimension incorporates contracts/agreements with partners/suppliers.

- Service provider and Service consumer relationships
- Organization's Partner and Supplier strategy
- Factors that influence supplier strategy
- Service integration management

A service provider's position will vary depending on their strategy for customer relationships. A service consumer will depend on its strategy for sourcing and supplier management. An organization's strategy should be based on its goals, culture, and business environment. Some may focus on core competencies, using partners and suppliers to provide other needs. Others may rely on their own resources, using partners and suppliers as little as possible. There are many variations between these two opposite approaches.

An organization may address the partners and suppliers dimension through service integration and management. This involves use of a specially established integrator to ensure that service relationships are properly coordinated.

Service integration and management may be kept within the organization, but can also be delegated to a trusted partner.

Factors that may influence an organization's strategy when using suppliers include:

- Strategic focus
- Either focus on core competencies and outsource non-core functions to third parties, or stay self-sufficient and retain control over important functions.
- Corporate culture
- Can cause historical preference (cultural bias) for one approach over another. This is difficult to change without compelling reasons.
- Resource scarcity
- If in short supply, a service provider may need to engage a supplier.
- Cost concerns
- A service provider may believe it more economical to source from a supplier.
- Subject matter expertise
- It may be less risky to use a supplier that already has expertise, rather than develop and maintain in house.
- External constraints
- Government regulation or policy, industry codes of conduct, and social, political or legal constraints may impact a supplier strategy.
- Demand patterns
- Customer activity or demand may be seasonal or demonstrate high degrees of variability. Patterns may impact the extent to which use is made of external service providers.

Recent trends include companies that offer technical resources (infrastructure) or capabilities (platforms, software) 'as a service'. They bundle goods and services into a single product as a utility, and is accounted for as operating expenditure. This frees companies from investing in costly infrastructure and software assets that need to be accounted for as capital expenditure.

## Value streams and Processes

- Defines how organization/SVS, work together to enable value creation
- Focused in how activities are organized, and ensure effective value creation for all stakeholders

- Activities the organization undertakes
- How activities are organized
- How value is ensure for all stakeholders efficiently and effectively

Value streams for service management:

- A series of steps to create and deliver products and services to a service consumer.
- A combination of the organization's value chain activities
- Derived from LEAN and it aims to improve the way a process adds value

Processes (in a matrix organization):

- Set of activities that transform inputs to outputs to accomplish an objective
- Well-defined processes can improve productivity within and across organizations
- Detailed in procedures who is involved and work instructions how they are carried out

## PESTEL

- Political
- Economic
- Social
- Technological
- Legal
- Environmental

External factors:

- Affect service providers.
- Can be analyzed with PESTLE. An acronym for political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors

External factors influence how organizations configure their resources and address the four dimensions of service management. For example:

Government and societal attitudes towards environmentally friendly products and services may result in the organization investing more in tools and technologies that meet external expectations. An organization may choose to partner with other organizations (or source services from external providers) who can demonstrate environmentally friendly credentials. For example, some companies publish product environmental reports that describe their products' performance against their policies around climate change, safer materials, and other resources.
