# Continual Improvement

Continual improvement takes place in all areas of the organization and at all levels, from strategic to operational. To maximize the effectiveness of services, each person who contributes to the provision of a service should keep continual improvement in mind, and should always be looking for opportunities to improve.

## Continual Improvement at all levels

The ITIL Service Value System supports continual improvement and value creation at all levels:

- SVS: ITIL continual improvement model, which provides organizations with a structured approach to implementing improvements
- SVC: improve service value chain activity, which embeds continual improvement into the value chain
- Practice: continual improvement practice, supporting organizations in their day to-day improvement efforts

## Continual Improvement Model

The continual improvement model applies to the SVS in its entirety, as well as to all of the organization's products, services, service components, and relationships.

The ITIL continual improvement model can be used as a high-level guide to support improvement initiatives.

Use of the model increases the likelihood that ITSM initiatives will be successful, puts a strong focus on customer value, and ensures that improvement efforts can be linked back to the organization's vision.

The model supports an iterative approach to improvement, dividing work into manageable pieces with separate goals that can be achieved incrementally.

It is important to remember that the scope and details of each step of the model will vary significantly based on the subject and the type of improvement.

### 1. What is the vision

- Each improvement initiative should support the organization's goals and objectives
- First step is to define vision of the initiative
  - This provides context for all subsequent decisions
  - Links individual actions to the organization's vision for future

Focus on two essential areas:

- Organization's vision/objectives translated to specific organizational unit so context, objectives, and boundaries are understood.
- High-level vision for the planned improvement needs to be created.

The work to do in this step is:

- Understand high-level direction
- Describe / understand planned improvement initiative in context
- Understand stakeholder roles
- Understand / agree expected value to be realized
- Clarify role of person/team in relation to organization's vision.

### 2. Where are we now?

- Success depends on clear/accurate understanding of starting point and impact
- An improvement journey from A to B, needs clear definition of Point A

Current state assessments

- Existing services, including: users' perception, competencies and skills, processes and procedures, capabilities of technological solutions
- Understand organization's culture, values and attitudes across stakeholder groups, to decide what level of organizational change management is required.
- Objective measurement for accurate understanding of issues with current state.
- Will help assess level of improvement by comparison with the initial state.
- This step is easier with a good measurement system in place

If this step is not taken:

- There will not be an objective baseline measurement.
- Effectiveness of improvement activities will then be difficult to assess

### 3. Where do we want to be?

- An improvement journey from A to B, needs clear definition of Point B
- A journey cannot be mapped out if the destination is not clear.

Gap analysis:

- Evaluate scope and distance to be travelled to achievement of initiative's vision.
- Target state represents progress towards vision, not entire vision.
- Actions are prioritized actions along the way to completing the vision
- Objectives CSF's and KPI's
- Critical Success Factors
- Key Performance Indicators
- Objectives need to be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

If this step is not taken:

- Target state will remain unclear.
- It will be hard explain what key stakeholders will gain from the initiative
- It can result in low support or even pushback.

### CSF and KPI

#### Critical Success Factor (CSF)

CSFs are Critical Success Factors that determine the success or failure of a objective.

- How will the Service Provider know when it is successful? When must those factors be achieved?
- CSFs are defined in terms of capabilities and resources, are proven to be key determinants of success by industry leaders, are defined by the market, are the basis of competition, are dynamic, usually require investment and time to develop, and the value is extracted in combination with other factors.

An important beginning point for highlighting improvement is to establish baselines as markers or starting points for later comparison. Baselines are also used to establish an initial data point to determine if a service or process should be improved. As a result, it is important that baselines are documented, recognized and accepted throughout the organization. Baselines must be established at each level: strategic goals and objectives, tactical process maturity and operational metrics and KPIs.

#### Key Performance Indicator (KPI)

- What does it really tell us?
- Does it really contribute to achieve our goals?
- Is it easy to interpret?
- Does it help us to decide on a course of action?

KPIs are Key Performance Indicators. The most tangible benefit to organizations using ITIL is a marked improvement in resource utilization, eliminating redundant effort, decreasing errors and the amount of work that must be redone and increasing scalability with current resource levels.

In addition, the ITIL framework helps improve the availability, reliability, stability and security of mission-critical IT services by providing demonstrable performance indicators to measure and justify the cost of Service quality.

The provision of KPIs is essential to supporting CSI. These KPIs become the data inputs to analyze and identify improvement opportunities.

An important aspect to consider is whether a KPI is fit for use. Key questions are:

- What does the performance indicator really tell us about goal achievement? If we fail to meet the target set for a performance indicator, does that mean we fail to achieve some of our goals? And if we succeed in meeting certain targets, does this mean we will achieve our goals?
- How easy is it to interpret the performance indicator? Does it help us to decide on a course of action?
- When do we need the information? How often? How rapidly should the information be available?
- To what extent is the performance indicator stable and accurate? Is it sensitive to external, uncontrollable influences? What amount of effort is needed for a change in result that is not marginal?
- How easy is it to change the performance indicator itself? How easy is it to adapt the measurement system to changing circumstances or changes in our goals with respect to IT service provision?
- To what extent can the performance indicator be measured now? Under which conditions can measurement continue? Which conditions impede measurement? Which conditions render the result meaningless?
- Who owns this KPI? Who is responsible for collecting and analyzing the data? Who is accountable for improvements based on the information?

### CSF and KPI Examples

Each organization should identify appropriate CSFs based on its objectives. Each sample CSF is followed by a typical KPI that supports the CSF. These KPIs should not be adopted without careful consideration.

Each organization should develop KPIs that are appropriate for its level of maturity, its CSFs and its particular circumstances. Achievement against KPIs should be monitored and used to identify opportunities for improvement.

Examples:

- CSF - All improvement opportunities identified
  - KPI - Percentage improvement in defects; for example, 3% reduction in failed changes; 10% reduction in security breaches
- CSF - The cost of providing services is reduced
  - KPI - Percentage decrease in overall cost of service provision; for example, 2.5% reduction in the average cost of handling an incident; 5% reduction in the cost of processing a particular type of transaction
- CSF - The required business outcomes from IT services are achieved
  - KPI - 3% increase in customer satisfaction with the service desk; 2% increase in customer satisfaction with the warranty offered by the payroll service.

### 4. How do we get there?

- Straightforward and direct for a single simple improvement
- If not simple, design experiments to test which options.

Work in iterations

- Even if path is clear, iterations are effective
- Each iteration is an opportunity to check progress, re-evaluate the
  approach, and change direction

If this step is not taken:

- Execution of improvements can fail to achieve what is required.
- Failed improvements erode confidence and can make it difficult to get support for future improvements.

### 5. Take action

- The plan for improvement is acted upon.
- This could involve:
  - Waterfall-style approach, expert detailed design followed by build
  - Agile approach, experimenting, iterating, changing directions, or even going back to previous steps.

Tips on taking action:

- Some improvements are part of a big initiative that makes a lot of change... other improvements are small but significant.
- A large change can consist of smaller improvement iterations
- Remain open to change direction throughout the approach
- Focus on results more than on sticking to the method

Take action by maintaining continual focus on:

- Measuring progress towards vision
- Managing risks
- Ensuring visibility and overall awareness of the initiative

### 6. Did we get there?

- Too often, it is assumed that the expected benefits have been achieved
- Path to improvement is filled with obstacles, so success must be validated.

Tips on how to check we did get there:

- Always check on:
  - Progress (have the original objectives been achieved?)
  - Value (are those objectives still relevant?)
- If not, additional actions are selected, resulting in a new iteration.

If this step is not taken:

- Hard to be sure that desired outcomes were achieved
- Lessons from this iteration will be lost.

### 7. How do we keep the momentum going?

- Focus of initiative should shift to marketing successes
- Reinforcing new methods and behaviors ensures that progress will not be lost
- It also builds support and momentum for next improvements.

Tips on how to to keep the momentum:

- Embed changes with organizational change management and knowledge management to avoid risk of reversion.
- Leaders and managers should integrate new methods and institutionalize new behaviors
- In case of failure stakeholders need to be informed of the reasons
- Failure requires a thorough analysis - the lessons learned
- Lessons include what can be done differentlv the next iteration
- Transparency is important for future efforts, regardless of results of current iteration.

If this step is not taken:

- Improvements will remain isolated and independent initiatives
- Any progress may be lost over time
- It may also be difficult to get support for future improvements
- It may be difficult to embed continual improvement in organization's culture
