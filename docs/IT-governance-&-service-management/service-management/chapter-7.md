# The ITIL Practices

The ITIL SVS includes 14 general management practices, 17 service management practices, and three technical management practices. All these practices are subject to the four dimensions of service management.

## What is a practice?

In ITIL, a management practice is a set of organizational resources designed for performing work or accomplishing an objective.

Each practice supports multiple service value chain activities. All these practices are subject to the four dimensions of service management.

The origins of the practices are:

- General management practices have been adopted and adapted for service management from general business management domains
- Service management practices have been developed in service management and ITSM industries
- Technical management practices have been adapted from technology management domains for service management

Practices with bold emphasis are required for the ITIL Foundation certification. These are the practices covered in this class.

## General Management Practices

General management practices have been adopted and adapted for service management from general business management domains.

We will overview these four general management practices:

- Continual improvement
- Information security management
- Relationship management
- Supplier management

### Continual Improvement

**Purpose:**
Align organization's practices and services with changing business needs through ongoing identification and improvement of services, service components, practices or any element involved in efficient and effective management of products and services.

Key activities of continual improvement practice include:

- encouraging continual improvement across the organization
- securing time and budget for continual improvement
- identifying and logging improvement opportunities
- assessing and prioritizing improvement opportunities
- making business cases for improvement action
- planning and implementing improvements
- measuring and evaluating improvement results
- coordinating improvement activities across the organization.

The scope of Continual improvement (as a General management practice) includes:

- development of improvement-related methods
- propagation of a continual improvement culture across the organization.

The commitment to and practice of Continual improvement must be embedded into every aspect of the organization. Without it there is a risk that operational concerns and project work can eclipse continual improvement efforts.

#### Methods and Techniques

Organizations should develop competences in methodologies and techniques according to their unique needs.

Different types of improvement may call for different improvement methods. Some improvements may be best organized as a multi-phased project or programme. Other improvements may be more appropriate as single quick effort.

For assessing the current state, many techniques can be used, like: SWOT analysis, a balanced scorecard review, internal and external assessments and audits.

Approaches to continual improvement can be found in many places, such as:

- Lean methods provide perspectives on the elimination of waste.
- Agile methods focus on making improvements incrementally at a cadence.
- DevOps methods ensure that improvements are not only designed well, but applied effectively.

Organizations should not commit to too many different approaches, but it is a good idea to select a few key methods so teams will have a shared understanding of how to work together.

When third-party suppliers form part of the service landscape, they should also be part of the improvement effort. Contracts should include details of how they will measure, report on, and improve their services over the life of the contract.
