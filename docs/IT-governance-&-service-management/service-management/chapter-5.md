# The Service Value System (SVS)

The ITIL Service Value System (SVS) describes how all components and activities of the organization work together as a system to enable value creation

- The ITIL Service Value System (SVS) operates across the four dimensions.
- Components, activities, resources can be (re)configured flexibly to suit the situation.
- This requires integration/coordination of activities/practices across the value chain.

- The ITIL SVS represents how various components and activities work together to facilitate value creation through IT-enabled services.
- These can be combined in a flexible way, which requires integration and coordination to keep the organization consistent.
- The ITIL SVS facilitates this integration and coordination and provides a strong, unified, value-focused direction for the organization.

## SVS Components

- Guiding principles give direction
- Governance checks progress against strategies, plans policies
- Continual improvement drives change
- Service Value Chain (SVC) aligns to above three components
- Practices provide guidance for activities in the Service Value Chain

The ITIL guiding principles can be used to guide an organization's decisions and actions and ensure a shared understanding and common approach to service management across the organization. The ITIL guiding principles create the foundation for an organization's culture and behavior from strategic decision-making to day-to-day operations.

The ITIL SVS also includes governance activities that enable organizations to continually align their operations with the strategic direction set by the governing body.

The ITIL service value chain provides an operating model for the creation, delivery, and continual improvement of services. It is a flexible model that defines six key activities that can be combined in many ways, forming multiple value streams. The service value chain is flexible enough to be adapted to multiple approaches, including DevOps and centralized IT, to address the need for multimodal service management. The adaptability of the value chain enables organizations to react to changing demands from their stakeholders in the most effective and efficient ways.

The flexibility of the service value chain is further enhanced by the ITIL practices. Each ITIL practice supports multiple service value chain activities, providing a comprehensive and versatile toolset for ITSM practitioners.

Every component of the ITIL SVS is supported by continual improvement. ITIL provides organizations with a simple and practical improvement model to maintain their resilience and agility in a constantly changing environment.

## Service Value Chain

The central element of the Service Value system is the Service Value Chain, an operating model which outlines the key activities required to respond to demand and facilitate value realization through the creation and management of products and services.

## The Service Value Chain and the Value Streams

- An operating model outlining activities that:
- Respond to demand
- Facilitate value realization
- Through creation and management of product and services

The six value chain activities are:

- Plan
- Improve
- Engage
- Design & transition
- Obtain/build
- Deliver & support

These activities represent the steps an organization takes in the creation of value. Each activity contributes to the value chain by transforming specific inputs into outputs. These inputs could be demand from outside the value chain or outputs of other activities. In this way the activities are connected to, and interact with, one another, with each activity receiving and providing triggers for further actions to be taken.

## Value Streams

- A value stream is a series of steps an organization undertakes to create and deliver products and services to customers
- Although the high-level steps are universal, different products and clients need different streams of work
- Examples of value streams:
  - Development of a new application
  - Changing an existing application

**They combine practices and value chain activities in various ways to improve products and services and increase potential value for the consumers and the organization.**

To carry out a certain task, or respond to a particular situation, organizations create service value streams. Service value streams are specific combinations of activities and practices, and each one is designed for a particular scenario, like solving an incident, the development of a new application or changing an existing application. The value stream will be designed specifically to be used in a particular scenario like this and will provide a complete guide to the activities, practices, and roles involved in a scenario. Once designed, value streams should be subject to continual improvement

### 1. Plan

- Ensures a shared understanding of: vision, current status, improvement direction
- It does this for all four dimensions and all products/services across the organization.

Information used in this activity amongst others are policies, requirements and constraints, value chain performance information, information about new products and services. This information will be used for example to make plans, portfolio and architecture decisions.

### 2. Improve

The purpose of the improve value chain activity is to ensure continual improvement of products, services, and practices across all value chain activities and the four dimensions of service management.

To give a more background on information used in this activity you can consider feedback from the stakeholders provided by engage or performance and improvement opportunities which will be used to plan and report improvement opportunities

### 3. Engage

Provide good understanding of stakeholder needs, transparency, continual engagement and good relationships with all stakeholders

An example of an input to this activity is contract and agreement requirements or opportunities from current and potential customers and users; this will be then used to design product and service requirements and contracts and agreements amongst others.

### 4. Design & Transition

To ensure that products and services continually meet stakeholder expectations for quality, costs, and time to market.

Some key inputs to this activity are architecture and plans, improvement initiatives, knowledge and information about new and changed products and services, then one of the outputs can be requirements and specifications for obtain or build.

### 5. Obtain/Build

To ensure that service components are available when and where they are needed, and meet agreed specifications.

Inputs are amongst others goods and services provided by external and internal suppliers and partners, requirements and specifications provided by design and transition change or project initiation requests.

These inputs are necessary to create output like service components for deliver and support and design and transition also to create contract and agreements requirements for engage.

### 6. Deliver & Support

The purpose of the deliver and support value chain activity is to ensure that services are delivered and supported according to agreed specifications and stakeholders' expectations.

Examples of key inputs to this activity are new and changed products and services provided by design and transition, service components provided by obtain/build.

Examples of the key outputs of this activity are services delivered to customers and users, information on the completion of user support tasks for engage, product and service performance information for engage and improve.
