# Digital Thinking Process

## Digital Thinking Principles

- Stay focused on topic
- One conversation at a time
- Encourage wild ideas
- Defer judgement
- Think user centered
- Work multidisciplinary
- Go for quantity
- Build on the ideas of others
- Be visual
- Fail early fail often

## Empathy

Empathy is the centerpiece of a human-centered design process. The Empathize mode is the work you do to understand people, withing the context of your design challenge. It is your effort to understand the way they do things and why, their physical and emotional needs, how they think about world, and what is meaningful to them.

1. Create a common understanding and identify the right challenge to solve
2. Identify the stakeholders
3. If required rephrase the Design Thinking Challenge
4. Create a project plan and team
5. Prepare for interviews

1. Brainstorm questions
2. Identify and order themes
3. Refine questions

---

1. Observe
2. Engage
3. Watch and Listen

## Define

The Define mode of the design process is all about bringing clarity and focus to the design space. It is your chance, and responsibility, as a design thinker to define the challenge you are taking on, based on what you have learned about your user and about the context.

After becoming an instant-expert on the subject and gaining invaluable empathy for the person you are designing for, this stage is about making sense of the widespread information you have gathered

1. Prepare space
2. Share raw data
3. Look for patterns and themes
4. Derive insights
5. Create personas and scenarios
6. Create Point of View

A persona is an aggregated profile of a specific user type.  
Personas enable creative teams to develop a shared understanding of their user (respectively people concerned by the challenge).

Personas have name, age, and personality traits so that the team develops empathy with the user and stops arguing about individual opinions.

1. Write the respective persona in the first column.
2. Phrase the need of this persona in a very crisp sentence (second column).
3. List the key insights you have for this persona in the third column.
4. Iterate with further personas.

## Ideate

Ideate is the mode of the design process in which you concentrate on idea generation.

Mentally it represents a process of "going wide" in terms of concepts and outcomes.

Ideation provides both the fuel and also the source material for building prototypes and getting innovative solutions into the hands of your users

1. Set a fixed time frame and bring the team in front of a white board
2. Write down clearly, what you are brainstorming. Using a "How Might We" question is a great way to frame a brainstorm

**Consider 5 components:**

- Actions
- Mindset
- Touch points
- Pain points
- Moments of truth

## Prototype

The Prototype mode is the iterative generation of artifacts intended to answer questions that get
you closer to your final solution.

In the early stages of a project that question may be broad — such as "do my users enjoy cooking in a competitive manner?"

In these early stages, you should create low-resolution prototypes that are quick and cheap to make (think minutes and cents) but can elicit useful feedback from users and colleagues.

In later stages both your prototype and question may get a little more refined. For example, you may create a later stage prototype for the cooking project that aims to find out: "do my users enjoy cooking with voice commands or visual commands".

- Start building.
  - Even if you aren't sure what you're doing, the act of picking up some materials (paper, tape, and found objects are a good way to start!) will be enough to get you going.
- Don't spend too long on one prototype.
  - Move on before you find yourself getting too emotionally attached to any one prototype.
- Build with the user in mind.
  - What do you hope to test with the user? What sorts of behavior do you expect? Answering these questions will help focus your prototyping and help you receive meaningful feedback in the testing phase.
- Identify a variable.
  - Identify what's being tested with each prototype. A prototype should answer a particular question when tested.
- Build the story around your idea and act it out

1. Prioritize
   - Prioritize one idea (or a combination of ideas ) to be realized as a prototype
   - Start refining ideas in first sketches, user stories or text descriptions. Potentially phrase a brief vision of the aspired solution
2. Tinkering
   - Start tinkering and make the solution as tangible as possible, for example, a paper box with wireframe sketches on post-its to represent a mobile device, a sketch of an user interface or a hand made model works.
3. Validation
   - Validate the concepts with end users and stakeholders. Collect as much feedback as you can and incorporate it into the prototype .
   - Try to increase the desirability and the technical feasibility with each iteration.

Prototyping can also be used for ideation of new business models or any other challenge related to entities with a business-like working model.

- Build the canvas collaboratively, starting with the different customer segments to be addressed by the solution. As different customer segments have distinct needs, you need to think of specific value propositions per segment.
- Map out all the remaining building blocks accordingly.
- It is also possible to start the canvas from other “epicenters”, for example, start with a particular technology as key resource.
- Use a large printed canvas (A0 format) or draw the canvas on a whiteboard and use post-its to consolidate the content.

## Test

The Test mode is when you solicit feedback, about the prototypes you have created, from your users and have another opportunity to gain empathy for the people you are designing for.

Testing is another opportunity to understand your user, but unlike your initial empathy mode, you have now likely done more framing of the problem and created prototypes to test.

Both these things tend to focus the interaction with users, but don’t reduce your “testing” work to asking whether or not people like your solution. Instead, continue to ask “Why?”, and focus on what you can learn about the person and the problem as well as your potential solutions.

A rule of thumb: always prototype as if you know you’re right, but test as if you know you’re wrong- testing is the
chance to review your solutions and make them better.

- Show don’t tell. Put your prototype in the user’s hands– or your user within an experience. And don’t explain everything (yet). Let your tester interpret the prototype. Watch how they use (and misuse!) what you have given them, and how they handle and interact with it; then listen to what they say about it, and the questions they have.
- Create Experiences. Create your prototypes and test them in a way that feels like an experience that your user is reacting to, rather than an explanation that your user is evaluating.
- Ask users to compare. Bringing multiple prototypes to the end to test gives users a basis for comparison, and comparisons often reveal latent needs.

## Pitch Your Solution

- Storytelling: stories are hard-wired into our psyche
- Dramatic Action: Your story should have 3 components: Action, Conflict, and Transformation.
  - Action: What is the character trying to do? What are the actions he/she is taking to achieve it?
  - Conflict: What is in her way? What questions linger beneath the surface?
  - Transformation: What is the big insight? How do the action and conflict resolve?
- Design Process is a Built-in Story: Use what you’ve learned during the design process.
