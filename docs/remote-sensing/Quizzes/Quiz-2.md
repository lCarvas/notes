## Q: What kind of imagery would be used for capturing changes over time at high frequency?

- **a**: MODIS imagery
- **b**: Sentinel-2 imagery

## Q: Which of the following is an example of an active sensor?

- **a**: Sentinel-1
- **b**: Sentinel-2

## Q: What is the trade-off between different types of image resolution in remote sensing?

- **a**: Higher spatial resolution usually results in lower temporal resolution, as the sensor covers a smaller area and takes longer to revisit
- **b**: Higher spectral resolution results in higher spatial resolution, as more bands provide finer detail in smaller areas

## Q: Panchromatic images capture one band

- **a**: True
- **b** False

## Q: Which one of these statements is true?

- **a**: Passive and active sensors acquire images during the day and night, respectively
- **b**: Passive sensors rely on external radiation sources, while active sensors emit their own radiation

## Q: Whatâ€™s the oldest earth observation satellite mission?

- **a**: Sentinel-2
- **b**: Landsat

## Q: What type of resolution refers to the smallest object that can be detected?

- **a**: Spatial resolution
- **b**: Spectral resolution

## Q: Which satellite sensor has the finest spectral resolution?

- **a**: Hyperspectral
- **b**: Multispectral

## Q: What type of radiation is most captured by optical remote sensing systems?

- **a**: Visible and infrared
- **b** Microwave
