## Temporal Resolution

The absolute temporal resolution of a remote sensing system to image the exact same area at the same viewing angle a second time is equal to the revisit period.

## Radiometric Resolution

The sensitivity the sensor has for recording variations in the elctro magnetic spectrum. Higher values mean that more subtle appearance changes in the image can be detected.
