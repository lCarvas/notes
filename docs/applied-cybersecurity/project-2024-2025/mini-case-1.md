# MC: 1 Sniffing using Wireshark

Attackers will simulate network attack; Detect the attack using Wireshark; the Defender will secure the detected vulnerabilities.

## Scenario

Neighbours, the attacked household, has a dog. Every time the attacked go walk their dog, the dog poops in front of their neighbour's/attacker's house. The attacker, tired of this behavior decides to get revenge on the neighbour. The attacker goes to the neighbour's house, pretending to need their Wi-Fi, because his own Wi-Fi is currently not working due to a mistake on the ISP's side. The attacker acquire the attacked's Wi-Fi password. The attacker knows that the attacked has a party every Saturday, on which they get their friends on their house and decide to stream a pirated movie. The attacker then proceeds to send a DOS attack to the neighbour's network, completely ruining his night, as the Attacked neighbour does not have any DOS protection. Fast Forward a bit, the Attacked neighbour acquires a software, (lets all thank the sponsor of today's video xd) Norton, which has DOS attack protection. The Attacked neighbour does not have their Saturday ruined, the Attacker still gets dog shit in front of their house. All is well when it ends well
