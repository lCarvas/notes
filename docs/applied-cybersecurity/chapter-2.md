# Working environment

## There are different types of working environments such as

- __Office environment__ : usually made up of ethical hackers and security experts that are working in an office trying to identify vulnerabilities
- __Remote environment__ : professionals also work from home using a __VPN__
- __Virtual environment__: common practice to to provide a safe isolated working environment

## Virtual environment

- __Virtual box__ : (Free) Runs on multiples machines and allows for the user to create multiple instances on a single physical machine
- __VMware__ : (Paid) More advanced than Virtual Box allows for more customization
- __Docker__ : This is a containerization platform. It is commonly used in DevOps environments and can be used
to create isolated environments for security testing

>Regarding the specifics of each please refer to the moodle slides

In the course of AP, we will be using Kali Linux given that it's a tool often used in ethical hacking. Kali can be used to identify and expose vulnerabilities in computer systems. Wide array of tools come already installed.
