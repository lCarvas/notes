# Exercise 18

$\widehat{bwght} = 119.77 - 0.514 \ cigs$

## What is the predicted birth weight when cigs = 0? What about when cigs = 20 (one pack per day)? Comment on the diference

$\mathbb{E}[\ \hat{bwght}\mid cigs=0 \ ] = 119.77 - 0.514(0) = 119.256$

$\mathbb{E}[\ \hat{bwght} \mid cigs=20\ ] = 119.77 - 0.514(20) = 109.49$

Smoking 20 cigs per day, reduces the estimated weight of the newborn by 9.77 ounces. This makes sense as cigs would affect the health of a baby.

## Does this simple regression necessarily capture a causal relationship between the child's birth weight and the mother's smoking habits? Explain

No, as the child's birth weigh is not only related to the mother's smoking habit. There are unnaccounted for factors that could influence bwght. Examples of this are, mother's eating habits, genetic defects, mental health status of the mother, etc.

## To predict a birth weight of 125 ounces, what would cigs have to be? Comment

$125 = 119.77 - 0.514 \ cigs$  
$5.23 = - 0.514 \ cigs$  
$cigs = -10.18$

## The proportion of women in the sample who do not smoke while pregnant is about 0.85. Does this help reconcile your finding from part (c)?
