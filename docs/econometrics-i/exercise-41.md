# Exercise 41

## a)

$\tilde{\beta}$ and $\hat{\beta}$ would be different, the omitted variables in the SLR model ($x_2,x_3$) are correlated with $x_1$, since their partial effect is also high, the bias would be noticeable

## b)

The values would be similar because $x_1$ is almost uncorrelated with $x_2$ and $x_3$

## c)

$se(\hat{\beta_1}) \gt se(\hat{\beta_1})$

## d)

$se(\hat{\beta_1}) \lt se(\hat{\beta_1})$
