# Exercise 20

$\widehat{\log{(price)}}=9.40 + 0.312\ \log{(dist)}$  
$n = 135 \ R^2 = 0.162$

## Interpret the coefficient on log(dist). Is the sign of this estimate what you expect it to be?

If the distance increases by 1%, the price will increase by 0.312%. This makes sense, the further away from the incinerator, the more expensive the house will be, living close to a garbage incinerator would not be a pleasent experience.

## Do you think simple regression provides an unbiased estimator of the ceteris paribus elasticity of price with respect to dist? (Think about the city's decision on where to put the incinerator.)

We're not controlling for all factors that woudl affect price such as:

- Quality of the Area
- Distance to Schools
- Distance to Services
- Criminality
- etc.

## What other factors about a house affect its price? Might these be correlated with distance from the incinerator?

See above, those could also be correlated with the distance from the incinerator.
